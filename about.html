            <p>It started with a dream, an ambition, and a determination to build better customer experiences. A vision to fulfill or a righteous path to emulate both our clients and team members. (Road to) progress for JAI JAAI VANTI.</p>
            
            <p>The parental organization formally known as VIKASH TECHNICAL SERVICES LLC was framed in 2008. The company was catering to the needs of freelancers. To increase its share of the ever-growing market, it teamed up with JAI JAAI VANTI to give its valued customers value for money.</p>
            
            <p>We were built with a strong foundation of team members and happy customers. It has always been a distant reality, and once one milestone is achieved, there is always another one waiting to be crossed. Almost instantly, JAI JAAI VANTI became a prominent name in its business segment, but as every entrepreneur sticks to their dream, we always wanted to push our company to more prosperous milestones. More than being a global player, we always perceived our company as a unit that could make a difference with its quality and competitively priced products.</p>
            
            <p>Taking a path less traveled, we expanded JAI JAAI VANTI with total in-house production, a highly sensitive business that requires a high amount of technical know-how, expertise, and specialized knowledge. The story was not always a fairy tale. We had several bumps along the journey. On every single story, our team and their dedication are what helped us to achieve the next milestone. These people made sacrifices along the way.</p>
